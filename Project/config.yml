  - "[&5SandRPG&r] The SandRPG plugin has been created with the intention to enhance the vanilla Minecraft experience, by adding races and buffs/debuffs."
  - "[&5SandRPG&r] There are four different races: &9Dwarves&r, &2Elves&r, &3Goblins&r, and &fHumans&r, the neutral race. Each one of them comes with different advantages and disadvantages. Once you have chosen a race, it is yours permanently unless you request to change it."
  - "[&5SandRPG&r] &9Dwarves&r are the race that thrives the best in the undergrounds of The Overworld. Your racial buff is that under sea level you receive a mining speed increase."
  - "[&5SandRPG&r] &2Elves&r are the race that thrives the best on the uppergrounds of The Overworld. Your racial buff is that above sea level you receive a movement speed increase."
  - "[&5SandRPG&r] &3Goblins&r are the race that thrives the best in The Nether. Your racial buff is that you take no fire damage in The Nether. However, you take a small weakness debuff while outside of it."
  - "[&5SandRPG&r] &fHumans&r are the neutral race of the world. Your race counts as human before you assign yourself another race. Humans are the most neutral of all, as they do not have any buffs or debuffs."
